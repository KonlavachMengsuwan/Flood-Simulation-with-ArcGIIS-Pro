# 🌊 Simple Flood Simulation in Nice, France using ArcGIS Pro

This repository shows how to create a basic flood simulation in **Nice, France** using ArcGIS Pro's built-in **Rainfall Simulation** tool in a 3D Local Scene.

## 🚀 Quick Steps

1. **Create a New Project**
   - Open ArcGIS Pro → `New Project` → select **Local Scene**.

2. **Set Basemap**
   - Go to `Map` → `Basemap` → choose any 3D basemap you like.

3. **Navigate to Nice, France**
   - Use the search bar or manually zoom to **Nice, France**.

4. **Zoom to Your Area of Interest**
   - Focus on the specific area you want to simulate (e.g., around the Var River or urban districts).

5. **Run Rainfall Simulation**
   - Go to `Analysis` → `Simulation` → `Rainfall`.
   - In the Rainfall Simulation pane:
     - Choose **area from camera view** → `Create Simulation in Area`.
     - Set:
       - **Duration:** `00:10:00` (10 minutes)
       - **Rainfall/hr:** `200 mm`
       - **Evaporation/hr:** `0 mm`
   - Click **Run**.

✅ Done! You will see the simulated water accumulation visualized on the 3D surface.

## 💡 Future Improvements

To enhance accuracy, you can:

- ✅ Use your own **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** as elevation surface
- ✅ Refine water flow using **hydrology tools**
- ✅ Add infrastructure layers (roads, buildings) for impact assessment
- ✅ Export simulation data for analysis
